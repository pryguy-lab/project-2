This project is about an API link to the Giphy website.
Simply enter a desired image in the input box and hit the button to retrieve images.

improvements are as follows:
  1) making the page append new images whenever the button is pressed multiple times.

  2) Creating multiple links to other data using API links.

  3) adding selectible color schemes using javaScript and css.
